    (following a report by Benedict Acton-Bond)

  o ....

  o minor changes in docs

v0.1-10   (2023-10-03)

  o getSeries: protect Examples against failed downloads.
    (The function has been returning NULL in such cases for
    many years, which is now also documented.)

    The Bundesbank apparently implemented measures against
    non-interactive use at the end of September 2023, which
    require a browser with cookies and javascript enabled.
    Should this change to the Bundesbank's website become
    permanent, the current download mechanism will be broken.

v0.1-9   (2019-05-16)

  o small changes in docs

v0.1-8   (2019-05-16)

  o support real-time data sets

  o getSeries gains new arguments 'return.class' (with
    support for "list", "zoo" and "data.frame"),
    'verbose', and 'dest.dir' (which allows caching of
    downloaded data sets). The default for
    'return.class' is "data.frame"; for the behaviour
    of previous versions, use NULL or "list".

v0.1-3   (2012-02-05)

    vectors of format 'YYYY-MM-DD' are now translated
    into the required 'MM.YYYY' format (with a warning)
